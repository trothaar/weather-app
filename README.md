# Free Code Camp Weather App

Free Code Camp Challenge No. 261 - Show the Local Weather
Build a weather app that is functionally similar to [this example](http://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV/)

When it is finished, this app must:

* Display the visitor's location and the local weather
* Display a different icon or background depending on the forecast
* Allow the user to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius

I am also choosing to display the date and time at the top of the page.
